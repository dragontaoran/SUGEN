# SUGEN
SUGEN is a command-line software program written in C++ to implement the weighted and unweighted approaches described by [Lin et al. (2014)](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(14)00471-6) for various types of association analysis under complex survey sampling. The program is written for 64-bit x86 based Linux. The most recent version can be downloaded here. It can perform single-variant and gene-based association analysis. In single-variant analysis, it can perform standard association analysis, conditional analysis, and gene-environment interaction analysis using Wald statistics. In gene-based analysis, it generates the score statistics and covariance matrix for variants in each gene. These summary statistics can be loaded into the software program [MASS](https://dlin.web.unc.edu/software/mass/) to perform all commonly used gene-based association tests. A brief documentation of SUGEN is available here.
